The survey should be mobile friendly above all else, students are almost guaranteed to be taking it exclusively on their phones. 
User interface needs to be streamlined, what I was thinking was when they open the survey, has front page saying what it is and has a continue button, 
then proceeds straight to the survey, where at the bottom is a finish button, then it can pull up a page saying thanks or whatever, but the faster they can take this survey, 
the happier they will be with it.
I know we can't capture user data, but is there a way where we can have them enter their CTC id at the start to verify that they are a student without capturing their data, 
that way we can ensure they are a student, and even though we couldn't check the id, just simply being required to enter it could scare away those who would want to-
- skewer the data by entering numerous inputs to mess with the surveys. 
Questions shouldn't be yes or no, but on either on a extremely unlikely- extremely likely or a 1-10 scale.
